This is a placeholder for your hero background image.

TO ADD YOUR HERO IMAGE:
1. Find or create a high-quality image (1920x1080px or larger)
2. Save it as "hero-bg.jpg" in this images/ folder
3. Delete this placeholder file

The CSS is already set up to use ../images/hero-bg.jpg as the background.

Current setup will show:
- Your hero image as the background
- Gradient overlay on top for readability
- Grid pattern overlay for the techy effect
- All layered beautifully together!

Recommended image ideas:
- Tech workspace with baking elements
- Code + cooking/baking scene
- Modern kitchen with laptop/tablet
- Abstract tech pattern with food elements
